# discord.js template bot

## About
A template Discord bot made using the discord.js library.
Designed for the people who enjoy making bots but can't be bothered to remake the same files over and over again.
Comes with basic events, developer commands and guides on how to make both.
If you're new to bot development, feel free to use this template, though if you don't know the basics of JavaScript, you should probably learn those before you start making bots.

## Setup
To get started with the bot, please follow the [setup instructions](https://github.com/aanthr0/djs-template/blob/main/docs/getting_started.md).
